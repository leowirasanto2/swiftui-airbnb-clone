# SwiftUI AirBnb Clone (for learning purpose)

**Background**
Apparently, I'm working as an iOS developer in a company that is using SwiftUI to develop their ios mobile application. I have the basic in iOS development but never using SwiftUI previously, only UIKit.
Hence, by this project I am trying to understand how to develop the iOS mobile app such as layouting and doing some logic into the UI by using SwiftUI. 

As the learning reference, I am using the tutorial from a youtube channel called AppStuff in a video from this following link -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ad4qLKep3U&t=4104s.
He frankly explain everything in that video, easy to understand and follow. Thank you to AppStuff.

**Status**
This project is currently in progress of development. However the basic UI has already been developed so you can pull this project for references.
